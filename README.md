# iNERD-A
## IoT Node ESP32 reactive distributed Automation

Arduino based PlatformIO Firmware Platform for ESP32 modules.

This is an approach to build a genetic software platform for ESP32 
based assemblies that can be extended by modules to fit the 
functionality of actual systems such as [m5stack](https://m5stack.com/) and [ttgo](http://www.lilygo.cn/).

The Core System shall provide a runtime environment with common webinterface and periodic call back functionality for the extensions. It also shall provide a command and control gateway mechanism that unifies the different communication methodes as REST, MQTT and maybe other.

Please see [Project Page](https://github.com/ridikuel/iNERD-A/projects) for ToDos.
