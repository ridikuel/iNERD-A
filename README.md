## IoT Node ESP32 reactive distributed Automation

Arduino based PlatformIO Firmware Platform for ESP32 modules.

This is an approach to build a genetic software platform for ESP32 
based assemblies that can be extended by modules to fit the 
functionality of actual systems such as m5stack and ttgo.
